<h1>Little's finally big enough to move into his new condo!</h1>
	

<p>We set up a cat carrier with a board run to the tree next to our porch; yet throughout Little's life he regularly came in 
	 through the cat door to visit; and raid our pantry for peanuts.  Little also regularly jumped on my head from our porch 
	 umbrella when he wanted to visit!  We learned baby squirrels must have B vitamins to survive to grow to this point or they
	  will not make it; and squirrels do not like to take their vitamins!

<p>Little was tiny when we found him laying on the lawn after tree trimming maintenance; we raised him inside and bottle fed him formula and B vitamins </b>
 until he was able to consume solid foods. Finally we were able to move him to his outside flat; yet he often preferred to be with us in ours!</p>

<p>Little thrived in his new condo; coming and going and exploring his world, and he always loved to eat.  Then after he had gotten bigger</b>
 we did not see him for a long while; then one day he returned with a mate and a very chewed up ear from scraping we assumed.  After this we regularly left</b>
  food out for them, and he would frequently invite himself him to visit or raid the pantry!</p>
