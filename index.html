<p>
	At 12:09am on July 2, 1952 while traveling to Los Angeles; Nancy Melanie Palmer was born to Terry Evans and Bradford Palmer to in Chicago IL;</b>
	 so true to the meaning behind the name &quot;Palmer&quot; (traveler/pilgrim to the holy land).  Her father Bradford fought with the esteemed Army Rangers</b>
	  unit which rescued American servicemen from Japanese prisoner of war camps in the Philippine Islands during the WWII; upon his return to the states he met his wife Terry,</b>
	   who was a nurse in the Army hospital where he received care.  Nancy was always very close to her father; she often recalled with fondness his loving</b>
	    influence on her life, but sadly lost him at the tender age of fourteen.  Her mother also passed away when she was barely out of her teenage years.</b>
	      Also during these fragile formative years she faced other serious trauma&apos;s that might have easily caused a loss of faith in life; yet despite these</b>
	       events she retained a deep caring for all life, and especially for any feeling isolated or lost.  Many holiday seasons she volunteered at a suicide</b>
	        prevention hot-line; and I know her intuitive calming spirit helped to prevent countless tragedies.  This gift also had the same effect on</b>
	         injured animals we frequently rescued; and I often ribbed her that when she crossed over she would instantly be surrounded by a loving mass of:</b>
	          bunnies, birds, rabbits, mice, squirrels, rats, cats, dogs, opossums, and so many other types of life that I lost count!  Nancy lived during a</b>
	           interesting period in Los Angeles; and many her friends were relations of, or members of some of the biggest acts in the music business of the</b>
	            1960&apos;s and 70&apos;s.  They also called her &quot;Salina&quot; (also spelled Selena); which means: &quot;daughter of the Moon&quot;, (a little more about this later).</b>
	              At this point I would like to mention the Stein family; who were a big part of Salina&apos;s life, as well as life long friends as close to her as family.</b>
	                Patty Stein and Salina worked together at Advent Management; which provided tour management for such band&apos;s as: Yes, Ronnie James Dio, and Def Leopard,</b>
	                 and Salina always spoke fondly of her and Patty&apos;s adventures at &quot;the office&quot; during this time.  Mark Stein is the lead vocalist</b>
	                  and keyboardist for Vanilla Fudge; and at Salina&apos;s request recorded a few of her favorite songs in their catalog.  It was also a pleasant surprise</b>
	                   for Salina earlier this year when she heard &quot;You Keep Me Hanging On&quot; during Ken Burns series on Vietnam; this was a blessing</b>
	                    as it brought back fond memories for her during a very difficult time. Salina also worked with George McIndoe and Paramount Studios in the 1970&apos;s doing research for several programs that were the front-runners to such shows as:</b>
	&quot;In Search Of with Leonard Nimoy&quot; and  &quot;Unexplained Mysteries&quot;; he presently runs Phantomscotsman Films LLC; and was one of the </b>
	producer&apos;s of the movie: &quot;The Bank Job&quot;.  George was also a student of Nancy&apos;s grandfather Ernest Palmer; a Rosicrucian with the original</b>
	 Golden Dawn Order, and the author of many articles and books in the 1930&apos;s including: &quot;The Secrets of Ancient Egypt&quot; and &quot;The Origin of Man&quot; among a few.</b>
	   Author and Professor Hans Holzer&apos;s wrote about Salina in one of his books: &quot;Psychic Yellow Pages: The very best psychics, card readers, mediums, astrologers, and numerologists&quot;</b>
	   : <a href="HansHolzer.html">See page 87 of book</a>. During our twenty-one years of marriage I often found myself in wonder because her predictions were so timely and accurate; and I always felt she must have inherited this gift from her</b>
	    grandfather Ernest Palmer.  She said at times however it felt more like a curse; because she could only perceive, yet not change the outcome of her visions.</b>
	      There were often times she would be so quiet; and I knew at these times she often carried the weight of world on her shoulders.  Salina was also deeply spiritual; </b>
	       and often felt ambivalent about her abilities, because it was as she said: &quot;a nonreturnable gift&quot;.  Though I feel this intuitive gift was a extra portion</b>
	       of the spirit we all share, and was an extension of her beautiful and sensitive angelic soul.  I have never felt indifferent about whoever used either of her first or last names: &quot;Nancy or Salina&quot; or &quot;Palmer or Ball&quot;; because</b>
	        she was so many incredible things to so many people.  To me she will always be &quot;Love&quot;; the nick-name I affectionately called her, and this is what she will always be to me.</b>
	             She was so shy about having her picture taken; but when she smiled the whole world shined, and I know my world apart from her will never be the same again.</b>
	               Below is one of her very many talented writings: 
</p>

</br>

<div>If all lips could speak the truth; and all pride was cast aside</br>
All greed and cruelty was packed away; and jealousy subside</br>
If Love could rule our universe; only kindness to every race</br>
Then one could glance into a mirror; and view God&apos;s true face</br>
</div>
